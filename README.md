# coq.nvim 🐔

Named after the [famous theorem prover](https://coq.inria.fr/)

`coq` also means `鸡` in [`français québécois`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoAhZPRBMgE), and I guess `🥖`.

Fast as FUCK and loads of features.

## Faster Than Lua

- Native C in memory B-trees

- SQLite VM interrupts

- Coroutine based incremental & interruptable scheduler

- TCP-esque flow control

More details at the [PERFORMANCE.md](https://github.com/ms-jpq/coq_nvim/tree/coq/docs/PERF.md)

## Features

**Note: Due to compression, reality is _faster_ than gifs**

### Fast as fuck

- Results on **every keystroke**

- Throttling? Never heard of her

- Real time [performance statistics](https://github.com/ms-jpq/coq_nvim/tree/coq/docs/STATS.md)

- Look at the gifs! The bottom few are the **fastest when I didn't show down on purpose** to show features.

### Fuzzy Search

- **Typo resistant**

- Recency bonus

- Proximity bonus

- Weighted average of [relative ranks & ensemble metrics](https://github.com/ms-jpq/coq_nvim/tree/coq/docs/FUZZY.md)

Error correction: `cour` -> `colour_space`, `flgr` -> `flag_group`, `nasp` -> `Namespace`

![lsp_snippets.img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ms-jpq/coq.artifacts/artifacts/preview/lsp_snippet.gif)

Install the [Nvim Official LSP integration](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)

**Requires 1 line of change to support LSP snippets**

```lua
local lsp = require "lspconfig"

lsp.<server>.setup(<stuff...>)                              -- before
lsp.<server>.setup(coq.lsp_ensure_capabilities(<stuff...>)) -- after
```

### Snippets

- [**Over 9000** built-in snippets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ms-jpq/coq.artifacts/artifacts/coq%2Bsnippets.json)

- 99% of LSP grammar, 95% of Vim grammar

- [Press key](https://github.com/ms-jpq/coq_nvim/tree/coq/docs/KEYBIND.md) to jump to next edit region.

_The `%` statistic comes from compiling the 10,000 snippets_

**See FAQ to see limitations due to upstream bug**

### CTags

- Incremental & automatic **background compilation**

- Tag location & context

- Non-blocking

![ctags.img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ms-jpq/coq.artifacts/artifacts/preview/tags.gif)

**Requires `Universal CTags`, NOT `ctags`**

```sh
# MacOS
brew uninstall ctags           # bad
brew install   universal-ctags # good

# Ubuntu
apt remove  ctags              # bad
apt install universal-ctags    # good
```

### Paths

- **Preview contents**

- Relative to both `cwd` and file path

![paths.img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ms-jpq/coq.artifacts/artifacts/preview/paths.gif)

### Buffers

- **Real time** completion

- **Fast** in files with thousands of lines

![buffers.img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ms-jpq/coq.artifacts/artifacts/preview/buffers.gif)

### TreeSitter

- Unicode ready

- I dont have a picture, its boring

**Treesitter is still unstable in nvim0.5: slow and crash prone**

The promise is that Treesitter will have real time parsing on every keystroke, but its actually too slow on big files.

The Treesitter source only parses on `Idle` events due to unrealized performace promises.

### Tmux

![tmux.img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ms-jpq/coq.artifacts/artifacts/preview/tmux.gif)

### Tabnine

- CPU preserving flow control

- Auto download & install & update

![tabnine.img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ms-jpq/coq.artifacts/artifacts/preview/tabnine.gif)

_T9 is disabled by default, I might remove it, if they do not improve the CPU usage. [Their own bug tracker](https://github.com/codota/TabNine/issues/43)._

### Statistics

### Validating config parser

- Prevents typos & type errors in your config

Here I make a type error on purpose inputting `string` instead of an `integer`.

## Install

**Minimum version**: python:`3.8.2`, nvim: `0.5`, sqlite `3.31.0`

Install the usual way, ie. VimPlug, Vundle, etc

```VimL
" This is the main one
Plug 'ms-jpq/coq_nvim', {'branch': 'coq'}

" 9000+ Snippets
Plug 'ms-jpq/coq.artifacts', {'branch': 'artifacts'}
```

## Documentation

To start `coq`

```viml
:COQnow
```

🌟 If required, it will ask you to run `:COQdeps`, please run it and do `:COQnow` again.

There is built-in [help command](https://github.com/ms-jpq/coq_nvim/tree/coq/docs/README.md)

## FAQ

#### Default hotkeys?

Always:

| key         | function                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| `<c-space>` | manual completion        |
| `<c-h>`     | edit snippet placeholder |

When completion menu is open:

| key           | function                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `<c-k>`       | move preview to bigger window |
| `<esc>`       | exit to normal                |
| `<backspace>` | backspace                     |
| `<enter>`     | select completion             |
| `<tab>`       | next result                   |
| `<s-tab>`     | prev result                   |

**When hovering over a result, entering anykey [a-z] will select it**

This is a vim thing, I have zero control over :(

#### LSP too slow to show up on keystroke.

You have some options, each has it's trade off:

1. Increase the `coq_settings.limits.completion_auto_timeout`.

This will slow down feedback on _every keystroke_, as `coq` waits for LSP.

2. Use the manual completion hotkey (default `<c-space>`)

Annoying! And the manual completion also has a timeout `coq_settings.limits.completion_manual_timeout`.

Some LSP servers will still fail to respond within the default `.66` seconds, in that case pressing `<c-space>` multiple times might actually help some LSP servers catch up, depending on their implementation.

#### Missing Results

On keystroke only a max of `coq_settings.match.max_results` are shown.

Use manual completion hotkey to show all results.

#### Some LSP servers give inconsistent completions

This happens when certain LSP servers give you 1000s of unfiltered results in _alphabetical order_ and you still have to respond in a few dozen milliseconds.

To eliminate `a-z` bias, `coq` does a random sort on the resultset and process and cache as many of them as possible within the performance window.

So if some results are not in the SQLite cache, and have yet to be processed, they will be missing. They might however still show up on later keystrokes.

Use the manual hotkey if you need to see everything.

#### Auto completion mess up snippet regions (the ones you can jump to)

This is an [upstream nvim issue](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/13816).

Theoretically I can work around this by writing my own nvim `extmark` reconciliator, or I can go and cuddle my puppy and let upstream fix it.

#### My vim crashed!

**Disable TreeSitter**

Treesitter still needs stability work.

Nothing like good motivation to improve my design than dumping 1000 results on my client every other keystroke.
